      <p>Hi, I’m Asta — a front-end developer moving from transport and logistics into the world of creating beautiful User Interfaces and pleasant User Experiences through code. My interest in building useful digital products began when I collaborated with a developer on an internal transport management system — I was on the business and user side, while they implemented the solution in code. <p/>
        <p>After completing the Front-end development an UX program with Birmingham University and later Programming at Baltic Institute of Technology (BIT), I continue building things for the web.</p>
        <p>Today, I build with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Astro, HTML/CSS, and Node.js, always aiming for clarity, order, and thoughtful design.</p>
